# Phase 6 — Project Scaffolding

Scaffold the project root structure directly. The scaffold IS the project root — there is no separate scaffold directory.

```
project root/
├── services/
│   └── <service-name>/
│       ├── src/
│       ├── tests/
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       ├── Makefile
│       └── README.md
├── libs/
│   └── shared/          # Shared types, utils, clients
├── docker-compose.yml   # Local dev environment
├── Makefile             # Root-level commands
└── README.md            # Getting started guide
```

Each service includes:
- Health check endpoint (`/healthz`, `/readyz`)
- Structured logging (JSON, correlation IDs)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration from environment variables
- Basic test structure (unit, integration)
- Dockerfile (multi-stage, non-root user, minimal base image)
